    <p>Hi! My name is Brooke Parrish and I am 28 years old. I am originally from El Centro, California and currently
      reside in Tempe, Arizona. I have a shih tzu named Hagrid, who I absolutely adore. Unfortunately, he lives with my
      parents in Yuma, Arizona. My hobbies include traveling to new places, going to concerts and dancing country swing.
    </p>

    <p>I have attended a few different Junior Colleges and received my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology from San Diego
      State. I moved to Phoenix to work for the Department of Child Services but soon realized that field of work was
      not for me. Currently, I work in the front office of a dental lab. My duties include disinfecting, scheduling and
      invoicing cases. I also provide excellent customer service to all of our dentists.</p>

    <p>Although, I like what I currently do, I have come to a dead end and have no more room for advancement. I started
      to practice software with codecademy and it really caught my eye. I hope to absorb as much as I can from this
      course and make a total career change.</p>
